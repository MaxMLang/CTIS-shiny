# CTIS-shiny

This R Shiny App is part of the analysis of the Covid Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) with special focus on mental health. CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviours, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities.
We used R Shiny to visualize the mental health variables of the survey and provided a spatial analysis of mental distress during the pandemic. We included continent and country levels to visualize the course of the mental health variables.
